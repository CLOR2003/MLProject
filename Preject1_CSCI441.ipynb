        "First, frame the problem in a way that makes the problem clear; the objective must be clarified to know what the problem is for. The objective is:\n",
        "1. to feed the machine learning system, the model's output.\n",
        "2. Other signals may be fed including the predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "When the solution is implemented, it should be able to predict housing prices in California. Because currently, housing price estimation is done by a team of experts who will manually calculate it through a complexity of rules. In which, it can be expected to take a lot of time.\n",
        "\n",
        "By providing a new solution through the project, all the complicated rules and calculations can be done much faster and more efficiently.\n",
        "\n",
        "The design of the machine learning system will be based around supervised learning which is perfect for tasks such as predictions using regression. For the ease of the project, batch learning is the chosen learning method.\n",
        "\n",
        "As for the measurement of the performance of the system, it will be measured through a root mean square error calculation because it is the best equation for determining the performance of predictions through regression. It emphasizes differences in predictions and actual values more which is crucial in determining performance since for our objective, it is to predict housing prices in which large errors make a big difference. The minimum performance needed for the project to be accepted is somewhere wihtin the median of the total datasets for predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Other problems similar to the one in being done in the project are stock market predictions. It could definitely be applied to; because the task required to solve the problem is another revolving around regression. In the long term, the ML system could definitely be reused for other problems too. Since, Human expertise in the area is limited nor as efficient. Manually solving the problem would require more time as human resources need to be deployed, in other words, man power. The amount of data required is tremendous as many things are to be taken into account such as size, rooms, conditions, and etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "Assumptions to be made and checked is whether the system actually needs the exact prices or does it actually need the categories in which the prices will fall into. Another assumption made is that whatever is fed into the system is going to output as expected, in more specific terms, prices.\n",
        "\n",
        "Fortunately, the project is about housing prices, according to the lectures, so it would be no surprise for the project to be a regression task. As for the second assumption, it would have to be verified below as the project commences."

        "In conclusion, to make machine learning we must consider the following checklist. They are framing the problem, get data, explore the data, prepare the data for machine learning to use, explore different model, get the shortlist that is the best one, fine-tune the model to a great solution, present your model, and finally launch your system. They are important when it comes to making the model. For instance, we need to decide what kind of problem we are dealing with, like making a model of housing prices in state. For this, we need to get a lot of data that can help us make better predictions for the model to make. When getting data, we need to remove the one that isn’t what we are looking for so that the model can be accurate. For instance, we remove data from the corresponding district, removing whole attribute, and removing value that is missing. Cleaning the data will allow us to fine fiddle around the hyperparameters. Grid search and random search allow us to fiddle around quickly. However, random search is best since it is faster finding the best fir model than gride search. Testing the result allows us to see if it the data return of what we expected, if it does then we can launch it."
